# Daniel Smith Portfolio

Welcome to my portfoio website! My name is Daniel and I have been working
towards this portfolio and put in about 20 hours, to present the material you see
here.

# Technologies

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Bootstrap v4.3.2

# Features

This project uses a vertical menu bar, which adds and elegant touch of intutive
user centric deisgn. It uses a bootstrap java script code to create the effect 
with a transtion timing of 1s and ease-in and out value.

## Features Left To Implement

The features which I would like to implement would be to add 
more animation to the sign up to recieve updates heading,allowing it to change 
color on click.

# UX

My goal with ux designn was to make sure that my cite was user friendly and 
easy to navigate. Through this project I strived to demonstrate the basics
of user friendly interface by adding links where people expect them to be, and 
using bolder fonts that were apealing to the eyes, and intriguing at the same
time.

# Testing

I had many trials while testing updating, and saving to my github repsository.
The youtube iframe from bootstrap which was implemented works as expected 
and I am very proud of that. The link goes to youtube where you can hear more
from the artist.

I ran into many problems from the very beginning with implementing my design 
plan. Although I tried on a mac and pc laptop to obtain proper links for 
the first 2 days to source content media for my page. I unfortunatly had to resort 
to using relative path links in my css and taking the url directly from the 
cites, which I got my background pictures, pexel.com and unplashme.com. I know 
this is not good practice, rather what is expected is a direct local file path 
from your machines directory to your cite.

As you can see in the, sign up for updates section, and follow section. It 
requires that you put in your email in order for you to proceed. That was done 
intentionally when wrting the code by adding *required for those fields so you
must submit a valid email address for the for the form to process your
submission.

# Deployment

This cite is hosted from Github directly from the master branch.
You may access the file through https://danieldev28.github.io/Kess_TheBand/

# Credits 

I would like to credit numerous cites for inspiration in ux design.
Cites used for my iframe <a href="http://www.usherworld.com/">Ushers website</a> 
sie used for my sign up for updates section.
<a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/">Taylors website</a> 
I would also like to credit google for any fonts and ablum covers you may see 
on the website.

List of fonts used:
 'Noto Sans SC', sans-serif;
 'Fira Mono', monospace;
 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;

# Media 

The media was taken from the youtube and iframe videos. Although 
the cite is uniuqely mine the pictures were taken 
pexel.com and unsplash.com. I used lunapic.com in order to get correct
dimensions for all pictures on the cite. This was not and easy process being a
beginner programmer and this being my first real cite. I had some struggles 
finding the right size for the images that would fit my predefined bootstrap 
framework. But overcame many of them through the help of my mentor abhay barthwal.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the use of bootstrap compenents. As well as 
w3schools.com for when I got stuck, I aslo searched overstack.com countless
time for more information to solve problems with my page when I was stuck 
on the harder portions. I am thankful that my project is finally closer to what 
I had envsioned, thorugh many nights of burning the midnight oil. Thank you for
veiwing this presentation of my HTML,CSS and Bootstrap practical application to 
a real project.
